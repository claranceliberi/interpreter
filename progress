p14

left the codebase with an logical error,

when TestNextToken in lexer_tests.go is run, initially the lexer starts from the second token
instead of the first token

why? because the lexer is initialized with the first token in the constructor and the NextToken method is called in loop before running tests

Fix: not yet determined
